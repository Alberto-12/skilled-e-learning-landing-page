## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main purpose of this challenge was to test the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to create an optimal layout depending on user's device's screen size. I learned how to work with background images, using responsive unites and CSS grid.

here's a snippet of a CSS code with grid which I'm proud of:

```css
.grid-div {
      margin-left: 2.5%;
      width: 95%;
      height: 60rem;
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      padding-left: 10px;
      margin-top: 20rem;
    }
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve all the techniques used in this project.

### Useful resources
