## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to work with flexbox grid and background images.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   margin-left: 2.5%;
      width: 95%;
      height: 60rem;
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      padding-left: 10px;
      margin-top: 20rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve all the techniques used in this project.

### Useful resources
